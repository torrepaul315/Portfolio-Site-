thoughts so far

intro splash image is set up,
? consider making font even bigger for name?

now onto nav bar

trying to get the on hover feature, but that was becoming a pain! just try and get it set up the jquery route at this point-spent a bunch of time trying to set it up with just css...!


get it set up with text, then consider adding in icons! bam!


for the projects, use the md bootstrap 1- on hover feature to change the color when you go over it and
2- also include the tooltip feature to get a lil pop up to show some additional info on the project! #just a thought


use formsspree for an email feature on the site!

consider- creat larger shadows off of background? was trying to use z-index but its not doing what I'd like

have social icons, but make them larger!
